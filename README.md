R_scripts accompanying our Ecology Letters paper titled: "Scaling issues of neutral theory reveal violations of ecological equivalence for dominant Amazonian tree species". 

Directory includes the following files:

- Script   ---------------------------> Script to run simulation in parallel and generate necessary data, including example dataset
- Script to create all figures -------> Script to create all figures (both main manuscript and supplementary material)
- Functions_3Dmodel.R ----------------> Script with necessary functions for both above mentioned scripts

- species_data.csv --> an example dataset based on Guyana/Suriname as detailed in the manuscript
- plotdata.csv ------> the plot metadata belonging to species_data.csv

- Forest_OSB_8000ha_m0_1185.rds --> resulting .rds file from simulation using migration parameter settings as explained in the main                                           manuscript to recreate figures
- Forest_OSB_m_uni.rds -----------> resulting .rds file from simulation using migration parameter near unity settings
- Forest_OSB_mnull.rds -----------> resulting .rds file from simulation using migration parameter near null settings
